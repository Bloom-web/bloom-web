                                If you have been working with Microsoft at a vendor firm and want to be part of a growing consulting and technology firm that works for a team and provides salary, bonus, and full benefits as part of our compensation package regardless of whether you’re on the bench, our firm is for you. Tired of being “off-boarded” when your contract ends? Tired of working as an individual PM versus as part of a team? Frustrated that you have so much to contribute but no-one will hire you because you don’t have a v-dash? Talk to our PMO Lead to discuss how we can help you grow your career. Our PMO is growing, is team-oriented, and working with several technology clients, not just Microsoft. Excellent opportunities for growth, career advancement and cross training with our Software Development team. Established relationships at Microsoft SMS&P, EPG, M&O, and/or the BGs a plus, with opportunities for sales incentives included. Interested in contracting with your current client under our firm’s brand with resources and tools to support you, that’s okay too.
