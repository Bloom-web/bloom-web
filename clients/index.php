                            Heather kept us on time, on budget and on track across many stakeholders with different objectives. We simply could not have delivered this project at such high quality and within our budget requirements without her leading the effort.<br>
                            Also, Heather brought great clarity and organizational thought to our web development project in helping customers navigate through our licensing offerings online in Public Sector. I think everyone on the virtual team found her ability to stay focused, balanced and on task in driving our project to success nothing short of amazing!<br><br>

                            I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate the tips and knowledge you gave us. I thought the tips you gave us regarding interview strategies were very useful. The key strategies such as having confidence, taking notes during the interview, taking criticism well...etc. were extremely helpful, especially to people like me who has never had a job interview before. (I was telling myself "This is what you're going to do, remember this!") You brought in points that I have never heard from any other professional, and I know they will be very useful in the coming years as I start pursuing a career.<br><br>
