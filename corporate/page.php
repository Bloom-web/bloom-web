                                            He created his first software project—“Alphabet Invaders” at the age of 14 on the computer that was his birthday present. Soon thereafter he created a Reversi board game and then got his first computer-related job teaching software development classes for a local computer store.
                                            <br><br>
                                            He went to school at the College of Charleston where he spent his junior year as a student in Munich, Germany. He made his first business right out of college and soon had enough money saved up to spend a year backpacking throughout Asia, including spending six months in Taiwan teaching English and doing graphic design at the China Post, a Taipei-based English-Language newspaper.
                                            <br><br>

He was recruited by Microsoft where he worked for five years as an architect and developer and eventually left to start his own consulting company&mdash;which is how he got to know the folks at Bloom.

                                Culture reflects the essence of Bloom because it directly affects the success of our strategy and hiring practices. 
                                <br><br>
                                Bloom's culture is grounded in a relentless desire to delight our customers through excellence, thought leadership, and innovation. It is grounded in our mission to increase value.

                                We value high accountability to leave the company and our clients better than the day before. We value high performance partners (employees) that are self-motivated and empowered to transform, mentor, and collaborate with integrity. We value honest, positive, and supportive communication. And, we also value fun and community.
