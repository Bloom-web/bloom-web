                            				 From street food to Michelin star restaurants, my globetrotting exposed me to abundant cultures and cuisines. Find me frequently pondering unusual restaurant menus&mdash;or concocting novel recipes at home&mdash;and sharing with anyone who's willing (commemorative selfies while feasting are routine).<br><br>
                                            Similarly, my career has followed a similar path&mdash;from humble math and neuroscience geek to working with innovative business thinkers in high tech and low tech IT/communications and security firms. Inevitably, I developed a penchant for enabling visionary ideas with diverse teams (best served over local food and beverage).

                                            Like many in this industry, my love of technology started at an early age. I’d gotten a computer for my 14th birthday and soon after developed my first program&mdash;Alphabet Invaders. From that point on the only distraction from my interest in software development was traveling the world, which I did for many years after graduating from the College of Charleston.​<br><br>
                                            When I eventually settled back down in the U.S., I found my home at several tech startups before spending five years at Microsoft as an architect and developer. This led to the creation of my own consulting company before joining the Bloom team.<br><br>
                                            Of all of these experiences, however, there’s nothing I take pride in more than seeing my kids discover their own strengths and interests and guiding them along their individual paths.​
