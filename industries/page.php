                                Visualizing dashboards to display industrial control system data means aligning the layout in a way that is generally consistent with the operator’s mental model of the process. Important information and key performance indicators have embedded trends and bright colors are used only to quickly draw the operator’s attention to abnormal colors and alarms. These are some of the key considerations when designing world class visualization for Oil & Gas Operators and executives. Bloom understand this industry and can harness big data to provide important insight.
