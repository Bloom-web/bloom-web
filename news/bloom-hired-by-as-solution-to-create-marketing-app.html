<p><p>AS Solution is an industry leader in global executive protection and security, with a wide range of solutions including the recent addition of security applications that take their services mobile.&nbsp; AS Solution needed something developed in time for the ASIS International conference they attend annually to draw in new clients. Bloom Consulting Group was enlisted to create a sharp marketing application that will be used for years to come by AS Solution.&nbsp;</p><p>The objective was to create an experience that could be used to tell the story of AS Solution and facilitate a deeper conversation between potential clients and AS executives.&nbsp; &ldquo;Both the solutions and the team at AS are very unique so we really wanted to create an app that matched that personality,&rdquo; said Rachelle Raymond, Project Manager at Bloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;The design and development were very collaborative and the end result perfectly matched what the client was hoping for.&rdquo;</p><p>The AS Solution app will be utilized as a sales and marketing tool for both current and potential clients.&nbsp; The newest marketing materials and data points are available at the touch of a finger and can be updated in real-time as it is an Azure driven application.&nbsp; &ldquo;For years, we have struggled with the ability to show customers that we go far beyond executive protection,&rdquo; said Christian West, Founder and CEO of AS Solution.&nbsp; &ldquo;With this new app, we are able to create a beautiful interactive story-telling experience that shows the full span of solutions and technology we offer and we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about it.&rdquo;</p><p>The AS Solution app is available in the Windows Store using the links provided below.</p><p>Windows users: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5z8d4" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5z8d4</a></p><p>Windows 8.1 users: <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/1cd40795-a5cd-440b-ae73-243f52f987c3" target="_blank">http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/1cd40795-a5cd-440b-ae73-243f52f987c3</a></p></p>
