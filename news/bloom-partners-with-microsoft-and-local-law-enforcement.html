<p><p>Every year, the <a href="https://www.fbinaa.org/FBINAA/Home/FBINAA/Default.aspx?hkey=41909122-e437-41aa-92e8-c6e9146de412">FBI National Academy Associates, Inc. (FBI NAA)</a> holds a training conference and exhibition where thousands of law enforcement professionals and Public Sector experts come together to take a peek at the latest and greatest technology the industry has to offer.&nbsp; Bloom Consulting Group, Inc. was enlisted by Microsoft to join them in presenting FBI NAA attendees with a demo of the Microsoft Enhanced Patrol Experience (MEPE), a custom Windows app that was developed by Bloom as part of the Microsoft Advanced Patrol Platform (MAPP).</p><p>The MAPP concept, a joint effort between Microsoft WW Solutions, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Global Security, and Worldwide Public Safety and Justice Teams, is specifically designed for law enforcement.&nbsp; With the specific desire to improve critical security processes, the MAPP and Enhanced Patrol Experience App was created to provide a streamlined experience for law enforcement where mobility and real-time information is crucial.&nbsp; Whether on a laptop, tablet, or mobile device the MEPE provides all data and intelligence in a single place regardless of whether or not the officer is at the scene.</p><p>Bloom executives and Experience Architects did a significant amount of background work in the field of law enforcement including numerous ride-alongs in order to see first-hand how the MEPE could improve the experience of interacting with applications over the course of a normal work day.&nbsp; An Azure driven windows application was created in order to provide a consistent, unified experience both in the car and on the phone.&nbsp; &ldquo;We believe in user-centric design, which means sitting with the users of our Applications.&nbsp; They are the true clients&rdquo;, said Heather Zindel, CEO of Bloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;To our surprise, police software is really designed for dispatchers, not officers.&nbsp; We were able to completely rethink the user experience for police officers from the laptop in their car to their mobile device.&nbsp; The result is a single pane of glass experience that is unlike anything on the market today.&rdquo;</p><p>The Microsoft Enhanced Patrol Experience is available to download from the Windows Store by visiting <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh1mtx">https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh1mtx</a>.</p></p>
