<p><p>Bloom Consulting Group, Inc., provider of world class business consulting services, is pleased to announce and welcome Andrew Herb as its new Vice President of Business Intelligence and Application Development. Bloom further positions itself for continued growth and innovation around enterprise and mid-market services that unify and present information in new and relevant ways.</p><p>Herb will be responsible for managing the firm&rsquo;s growing BI practice as well as expanding Bloom&rsquo;s service offerings to include application development and mobile services. &ldquo;Andrew is a welcome addition to our management team,&rdquo; said Heather Zindel, President of Bloom Consulting Group. &ldquo;His Microsoft Windows and business intelligence knowledge, commitment to innovation, and strategies to build high-performance development teams at scale will further accelerate our business plan objectives.&rdquo; As mobile devices become the technology, and as desktop, tablet, and smartphone users move away from websites to applications, businesses will need to develop better platform and application strategies to land their internal and external messages.</p>Two of the services that we are really excited to offer our clients are Microsoft Windows 'Apportal' and cross-platform development services. Microsoft&rsquo;s new Apportal solution can deliver a customized user experience based on role or geography location and centralize LOB apps and information for enterprise employees. Apportals also provide users with live tiles that display real-time integrated business intelligence from multiple sources into a unified view. With the upcoming release of Windows 10, which will be designed to work across PCs, tablets, and smartphone, we believe we will be able to create universal applications that will run across various devices supporting Windows 10. We are betting on Microsoft and Windows 10,&rdquo; said Zindel.Herb brings more than 16 years of technology experience to Bloom, including a positive track record working with industry leaders that include Compaq, Disney, Microsoft, and T-Mobile.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/600077" target="_blank">http://www.pr.com/press-release/600077</a></p>
