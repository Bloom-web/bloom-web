<p><p>Bloom Consulting Group, Inc., provider of world class business consulting services, announced the appointment of Nicole Watson to Vice President of Client Services, and the opening of a new Washington, D.C. sales office. Nicole has been with the firm for three years.</p><p>We are delighted Nicole has chosen to take on this new role,&rdquo; said Heather Zindel, the firm&rsquo;s President. &ldquo;Her solid track record of high client satisfaction and her pledge to always &lsquo;over deliver&rsquo; makes her the ideal person to lead client services on the east coast for Bloom. Nicole also has deep experience helping organizations build better technology strategies.&rdquo; As mobile devices become the technology, and as desktop, tablet, and smartphone users move away from websites to applications, businesses will need to develop better platform and application strategies to land their internal and external messages. &ldquo;Nicole is one of the best people in the firm to help our clients build these strategies,&rdquo; said, Zindel. &ldquo;Two of the services that we are really excited to offer our clients are Microsoft Windows 'Apportal' and cross-platform development services. Microsoft&rsquo;s new Apportal solution can deliver a customized user experience based on role or geography location and centralize line of business (LOB) apps and information for enterprise employees. Apportals also provide users with live tiles that display real-time, integrated business intelligence from multiple sources into a unified view. With the upcoming release of Windows 10, which will be designed to work across PCs, tablets, and smartphones, we believe we will be able to help our clients devise new technology strategies and create universal applications that will run across various devices supporting Windows 10. We are betting on Microsoft and Windows 10 to light up client conversations.&rdquo;</p><p>Prior to Bloom, Nicole served as Vice President of Business Integration and Global Marketing for a global, private security company. Earlier in her career she worked with industry leaders such as Microsoft, IBM, Siemens, Deloitte, and SAP and as Director of Strategic Partnerships and Global Channel Marketing for an IT and data security manufacturer. She has also managed process reengineering teams for a voice/data systems integrator, and managed capital expenditures and FCC licenses for a start-up digital wireless provider.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pr.com/press-release/600078" target="_blank">http://www.pr.com/press-release/600078</a></p></p>
