They act as facilitators to problem-solve and provide insight using a best practice approach to help clients reach their business objectives. What does a facilitator do?

                                    It's easy to get so pumped up about technology and the function of software, that we forget the end user. The reality is that although we work hard to make the applications we build work, the user just expects them to work. After that, they want their experience to be intuitive and seamless across devices. Bloom's world class experience architects work tirelessly to ensure the UI (refers to the visuals and controls of your application) and the user experience (encompasses both the UI and the behavior of the application related to the UI as well as the "feeling" the user gets from the app) is awesome.
