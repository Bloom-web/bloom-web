<p><p>Bloom Consulting Group -- a growth-oriented business management consulting firm that delivers strategic services to marketing, sales, channel, and security executives -- announced that it has finalized a sales and services partnership with Triaster USA to provide business process management (BPM) software and solutions to new and existing Bloom clients.
<br><br>
Through this relationship Bloom is able to use Triaster’s BPM cloud solution as part of the tool kit that its consultants leverage to deliver customer project engagements. And for customers that choose to adopt Triaster on a long-term basis, Bloom has Triaster Certified Professionals on staff that can provide the complimentary sales-advisory, training and onboarding services needed to ensure success.
<br><br>
“There's a little bit of business process in almost every project we do”. said Heather Zindel, Bloom C.E.O. “Where it makes sense to document those processes more formally than, say, PowerPoint my consultants get a tremendous productivity boost using Triaster -- which translates into time savings, lower-costs, and higher-quality results for our customers.”
<br><br>
Triaster USA will assist with business development to help Bloom find prospective customers with business process needs, and will provide complementary process consulting capacity as well as platform-specific technical skills.
<br><br>
“This is definitely a win-win-win relationship for Bloom, Triaster, and our mutual customers” said Stan Julien, co-founder of Triaster USA.  “We are very excited to have Bloom as an authorized Triaster USA Services Partner and we anticipate the relationship will translate into solid growth for both companies.”
